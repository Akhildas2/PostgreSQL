# Transactions

## 1.What is a Transaction?

A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, maintaining the database's consistency and integrity.

## 2.ACID Properties

Transactions adhere to four key properties, often abbreviated as ACID:

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database in its initial state.

2. **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.

3. **Isolation**: Transactions do not affect each otherâ€™s execution, and their operations are isolated from other transactions.

4. **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and survive any system crashes or failures.

## 3.Transaction Control Statements in PostgreSQL

1. **BEGIN** / **START TRANSACTION**

   - Initiates a new transaction.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     ```

2. **COMMIT**

   - Saves all changes made during the transaction. It marks the transaction as successful.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     COMMIT;
     ```

3. **ROLLBACK**

   - Reverts all changes made during the transaction, discarding any modifications.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     ROLLBACK;
     ```

4. **SAVEPOINT**

   - Creates a point within a transaction to which you can roll back if needed.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
     ```

5. **RELEASE SAVEPOINT**

   - Removes a savepoint, making it no longer available for rollback.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
     ```

6. **ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT**

   - Rolls back to a specified savepoint, discarding changes made after it.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
     ```

## 4.Example of a Transaction in PostgreSQL

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Example SQL operations
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

If an error occurs during the operations, you can use a savepoint and rollback if needed:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Suppose an error occurs here, roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Release the savepoint
RELEASE SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Alternatively, rollback the entire transaction
-- ROLLBACK;
```

## 5.Using Transactions in Different SQL Dialects

1. **PostgreSQL**: Supports `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`, and `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`.
2. **MySQL**: Supports `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.
3. **SQL Server**: Supports `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT TRANSACTION`, `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

## 6.Best Practices

- Always use transactions for operations that involve multiple statements to ensure data integrity.
- Keep transactions short and avoid holding them open for long periods to reduce locking issues.
- Handle exceptions and rollbacks properly to maintain consistency.
